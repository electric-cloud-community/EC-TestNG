    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
What is the tool itself is used for in the development
process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>TestNG is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit,
    but it introduces new functionalities that make it more
    powerful and easier to use.</p>

    <h2>TestNG Links</h2>

    <p>More information can be found at <a href=
    "http://testng.org/">TestNG home page</a>.</p>

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to TestNG</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin calls the TestNG tool via command line
    and passes the user-provided parameters.</p>

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin includes the most important features
    provided by the TestNG tool, also allows some extra
    funcionality to make the test more configurable according to
    specific needs.</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow itself provides some advantages like
    parameters checking, easy functionality selection using only
    check boxes or radio buttons, hitorical log reports, procedure
    duration statistics, simple credentials attachment, real time
    analysis of the log been generated, among others.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against TestNG version
    5.14.6.</p>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class='required'>bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="runTestNG"><a name='runTestNG' id="runTestNG"></a>

    <h3>Run TestNG</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows the input of all necessary parameters
    along with some extra of them to make the test more
    configurable. When the parameters are defined the TestNG test
    command is created and run into the Commander, displaying at
    the end the result(s) of it. It displays a summary with the
    total of test run, the failures and skipped test(s), this is
    also a link to the specific failed test(s) or the ones that
    have warnings, to know where and which one failed. It also
    creates a log file, which contains the output generated by the
    console.</p>

Unfortunately, I can't tell you what exactly to put here, but it's OK to put what seems like too much! Include both parameter
values and output where appropriate. Use a separate 'h2' header for each example. Under the h2 header try to stay with the style
outline used above where possible.
